# PortSwigger Web Security Academy Writeups

This folder contains my hands-on lab writeups from **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.

The purpose of these writeups is to document:
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Exploitation techniques
- Security concepts learned through practical labs

## Covered Topics

- Authentication vulnerabilities
- Access Control flaws
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- File Upload vulnerabilities
- Command Injection
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Other web security issues

## Methodology

For each lab, I:
1. Analyzed the vulnerability
2. Exploited the weakness using tools such as **Burp Suite**
3. Documented the attack steps
4. Explained the impact and mitigation
